# Melbourne Bike Trails: Weather Effects on Bicycle Traffic 🚲☔🌡️

A comprehensive analysis of how weather conditions affect bicycle traffic and trail usage in Melbourne, with interactive maps and analytics.

## 📊 Overview

This repository contains data, analysis, and visualizations examining how Melbourne's bicycle traffic is affected by seasonal and shorter-term weather conditions. The project investigates how inclement weather leads to changes in cycling patterns, route choices, and transport mode switches.

## 🌦️ Background

In an article reported by Jonathan Corcoran and colleagues in The Conversation¹ and later highlighted by ABC News², research shows that bad weather can significantly impact planned journeys, leading to rescheduling, rerouting, or cancellation. This results in increased traffic congestion, more accidents, travel delays, mental stress, environmental pollution, and general travel dissatisfaction.

People who travel by bike or on foot are most likely to change their travel plans or switch to alternative transport modes rather than arrive at their destination drenched and uncomfortable. Some cities are trying to combat this issue by introducing innovations such as heated bicycle lanes and sheltered walkways.

This project was developed to investigate how bicycle traffic in Melbourne is affected by both seasonal weather patterns and shorter-term weather conditions.
