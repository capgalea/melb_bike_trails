The affect of Weather upon Bicycle Traffic in Melbourne


Background:

In an article recently reported by Jonathan Corcoran and collegues in the Conversation (1) and later highlighted by ABC News (2) discusses how bad weather can lead to planned journeys being rescheduled, rerouted or cancelled. This can lead to increases in traffic congestion and accidents, travel delays, mental stress, environmental pollution and general travel dissatisfaction. 

The fact that people who travel by bike or walking are most likely to change their travel plans and change their mode of transport rather than arrive at their destination drenched and uncomfortable.Some cities are trying to combat this by introducing such innovations as heated bicycle lanes and sheltered walkways.

This app has been developed to investigate how bicycle traffic is affected by seasonal and shorter-term weather conditions in Melbourne.
