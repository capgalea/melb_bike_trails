## The Affect of Weather upon Bicycle Traffic in Melbourne 🌦️

### Background:
In an article recently reported by Jonathan Corcoran and colleagues in the Conversation (1) and later highlighted by ABC News (2), it was discussed how bad weather can lead to planned journeys being rescheduled, rerouted, or cancelled. This can result in:

- 🚗 Increased traffic congestion
- 🚑 More accidents
- 🕰️ Travel delays
- 😞 Mental stress
- 🌍 Environmental pollution
- 😒 General travel dissatisfaction

People who travel by bike or walking are most likely to change their travel plans and mode of transport rather than arrive at their destination drenched and uncomfortable. Some cities are trying to combat this by introducing innovations such as heated bicycle lanes and sheltered walkways.

This app has been developed to investigate how bicycle traffic is affected by seasonal and shorter-term weather conditions in Melbourne.
